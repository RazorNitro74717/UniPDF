# UniPDF
Little application to convert a maximum of 4 documents (pdfs or jpgs) into one

Uses some libraries to convert pdf to image and viceversa, such as fitz and reportlab. 

Also uses tkinter for an easy and intuitive use on windows, and os to manipulate files and extension names.

More updates soon...
